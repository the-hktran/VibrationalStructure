There are three main folders:
(1) folder "coef" includes coefficients file for water dimer 2-body dipole moment 

(2) folder "lib" includes compiled library files

(3) folder "source_lib" includes source file to compile library files

(4) folder "DMS" provides an example for compiling codes and calculating  dipole moment

The following example are using ifort compiler, user can switch to other compilers like gfortran if needed.

To run the code:

(I) Go to source_lib folder

    Compile the library source files through "./mke"

    copy file "libdms2b.a" to folder "lib"

(II) Go to "DMS" folder

     1. Check "Makefile" to make sure you are using effective fortran compiler (we use ifort in this case)

     2. chg.f90 and ltp2011_dms.f90 are for water 1-body dipole moment fitted by  Lodi and Tennyson

     3. dms_shell.f90 includes subroutines that combines 1-body dipole and our 2-body dipole
        subroutine dms_init() specifies the path of 2-body dipole coefficients. chage the path as needed

     4. getdms.f90 is code to calculate dipole moment for coordinates in format of H H H H O O   

     5. Compile the code through "make getdms.x"
 
     6. Run the test code "./getdms dimer.xyz", you should obtain output like following:
       1.01164139592570      -2.040879096140672E-006  1.969461833075527E-002
